        <p>(July 11, 1916 - August 16, 1993) was an American electrical engineer with the National Advisory Committee for
        Aeronautics (NACA), and then with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) upon its replacement of NACA
        in 1958. She was the first woman to graduate from the University of Virginia's engineering program in 1939, receiving
        the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award upon graduation. When she was hired by NACA the same year, she became the first woman
        engineer at the organization, eventually rising to the title of Branch Head and managing several of its wind tunnels.
        Her work contributed to research on aeronautics, supersonic flight, airfoils, and aircraft design standards.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>The NACA Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (later the Langley Research Center) hired Joyner as a junior civil
        engineering aide in September 1939, making her their first woman engineer. At the time, the organization was
        expanding its aeronautics research and development in the time before World War II. Her career developed quickly, as
        she shifted her focus from civil to electrical engineering. Among her responsibilities was the management of the
        electrical systems for several wind tunnels, including supersonic wind tunnels, large, expensive facilities important to
        testing aircraft. She continued working at Langley for more than three decades, continuing at the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when it replaced NACA in 1958. By the 1960s, she achieved the title Branch
        Head of the Facilities Cost Estimating Branch, Office of Engineering and Technical Services.
        
        Over the course of her career at NACA/NASA, Joyner made contributions to research on aeronautics, supersonic flight, and
        the design of airfoils. Her work had implications for military and commercial flight applications, and she was
        influential in the production of aircraft design standards that continued to be relevant many years later. She
        retired from NASA in May 1971.
